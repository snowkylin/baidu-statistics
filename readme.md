# Baidu Statistics

**UPDATE: Since next day Baidu hides the url of Baijiahao in the search result (so one cannot distinguish them from other results without opening the link), current version of the program cannot work anymore.**

A simple Python 3 project to give some statistics information about [Baidu Search Engine](http://www.baidu.com), the 1st Search Engine in Mainland China.

Currently, it contains:

* Statistic of The average amount of Baijiahao (http://baijiahao.baidu.com) links on the first page of search result, mainly based on two keyword sources:
    * Sogou Hot Keyword List http://top.sogou.com
    * Baidu Hot Keyword List http://top.baidu.com/buzz?b=42&fr=topindex
